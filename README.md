# ENM-5310-VIT
# Vision Transformer Experiments  

This repository contains two Colab notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of Vision Transformers (ViT) on datasets such as **MNIST**, **Fashion MNIST**, and **CIFAR-10**. We applied techniques like **regularization**, **data augmentation**, and **hyperparameter tuning** to achieve improved accuracy scores.  

## Notebooks  

1. **Final Notebook in PyTorch**  
   This notebook implements the Vision Transformer using PyTorch, showcasing the techniques and methods mentioned above.  

2. **mnist_jax**  
   This notebook defines a Vision Transformer (ViT) model using JAX and Flax, focusing on a streamlined implementation for MNIST.  

Feel free to explore these notebooks to understand how ViT architectures can be applied effectively across datasets and frameworks!
